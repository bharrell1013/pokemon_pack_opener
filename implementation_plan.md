# Pokemon Pack Simulator Implementation Plan

## Current State
- 3D rendered rectangle is visible
- Basic card generation structure is in place
- Hardcoded Pokemon data available

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Card Generation System (Priority: High)
- **Complete CardDatabase Implementation**
  - Expand hardcoded Pokemon data with:
    - More Pokemon entries
    - Proper type assignments
    - Rarity weights and distribution
  - Update card generation methods to use proper Pokemon types
  - Implement better random selection logic for card rarities

### 2. Card Rendering System (Priority: High)
- **Texture Loading**
  - Create/obtain card template textures
  - Implement dynamic texture generation based on Pokemon type
  - Set up proper texture loading in Card class
- **Special Effects**
  - Holographic effect for holo cards
  - Reverse holo pattern
  - Full art card effects
- **Card Layout**
  - Implement proper card spacing
  - Add card flip animations
  - Create smooth transitions between cards

### 3. Card Interaction System (Priority: Medium)
- **Card Navigation**
  - Add ability to cycle through cards
  - Implement proper card rotation
  - Add card zoom functionality
- **Card Selection**
  - Implement card highlighting
  - Add click/touch interaction
  - Create card detail view

### 4. Pack Opening Animation (Priority: Low)
- **Opening Sequence**
  - Implement proper pack model deformation
  - Add particle effects
  - Create card reveal animation
- **Transitions**
  - Pack to cards transition
  - Card arrangement animation

### 5. Polish and Integration (Priority: Low)
- Add proper error handling
- Implement loading screens
- Add sound effects
- Create proper UI elements
- Add pack statistics tracking

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete Card Generation**
   - Update CardDatabase class to use proper type assignments
   - Expand hardcoded Pokemon data
   - Implement proper rarity distribution

2. **Setup Texture System**
   - Implement texture loading in Card class
   - Create basic card templates
   - Add type-based visual variations

3. **Implement Card Navigation**
   - Add ability to cycle through generated cards
   - Implement basic card rotation
   - Create simple card layout system

## Notes
- Using hardcoded Pokemon data instead of API integration
- Focus on core functionality first before adding special effects
- Prioritize card generation and rendering systems before animations
